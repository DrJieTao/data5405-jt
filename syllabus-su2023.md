## Course Deliverables
__ALL__ course materials will be made available via Google Classroom and Google Colab/Forms. You need your student email address (`@student.fairfield.edu`) to access them.
### Labs/Assignments
Each lecture is accompanied with a lab part, which includes hands-on work for the corresponding lecture, as well as the previous lectures. You are supposed to follow the instructions and work on these excercises , and turn them in to Google Classroom (in the format of Colab Notebooks) in a timely manner.
You are __encouraged to collaborate__ with your peers. However, you are also responsible for learning the key lessons of each assignment. So, if you need help, ask for it and pay attention to the answers. If you know how to help someone (without doing the work for them), then please help them out. 
In some of the labs, there are scattered __PRO TIPs__ sections that develop your __professional__ coding skills. Although they are not required, you are __highly encouraged__ to work on them.
Each assignment worth `50` points. You need to submit the complete lab notebook __individually__ to Google Classroom.

### DataCamp Assignments
As one of the largest learning communities, DataCamp provides ample learning materials on Python (for free for FU students)! You are required to complete the selected course chapters (1 per 2 weeks, or bi-weekly). Note that even though I carefully selected the materials, there might be slight misalignments between the DataCamp assignments and the course materials. You are __expected__ to do some self learning. Reach out to me, your Python tutor, for help. And keep in mind StackOverflow is your best friend!

<!--The class is divided into three modules, and after each module, you have a quiz for the content of the module. Each quiz worth `50` points.
The quizzes are __close book, close notes, close Python, close Internet, ...__. Put in your best __INDIVIDUAL__ effort in them. Collaboration will be considered __academic dishonesty__ in the quizzes.
Each quiz will contain several multiple choice questions testing your understanding of Python as a language, as well as coding/coding completion problems testing your proficiency in Python./-->

### Workshops
The synchonuous workshops are designed to review the contents of the three modules in this course.
During the workshops, we will work on a few coding problems together. These are your best chance to put whatever you learned in this class into actual use. The workshops are held over Zoom on a few Sunday afternoons (see __Course Outline__ at the end of the syllabus for specific dates).
Each workshop worth `100` points. Students are expected to turn in the complete notebooks to Google Classroom.

### DataCamp Assessment

In lieu of a final exam, you are expected to pass an assessment on DataCamp (will be assigned to you in our DataCamp group). The assessment has 15 - 20 __multiple-choice__ or __code-completion__ problems. Each problem is timed (45 seconds). You will need to submit a screenshot of your grade on the assessment to Google Classroom to earn your grades in this course. Goes without saying the assessment is close-book, close-Python, close-Google, etc.
The final coding challenge worth `150` points in this course. 



### Participation and Professionalism
Given the large class enrollment and the technical nature of the subject, it is critical that everyone take a professional approach to learning the material. Students are expected to come to class prepared and then participate in all activities to the best of their abilities. Cheating, free-riding, and other unprofessional behavior will not be tolerated.
#### In Lecture Exercises
There are a few `pulse check` sections in the lecture notebooks. Students are expected to complete them based on the given instructions. Turning the completed lecture notebooks in will contribute to the __Participation and Professionalism__ grade. See below for the detailed rubric.

| Assessment Points | Course Points 
:--- | :--- |
| 100 & above | 150 |
| 90 - 99 | 135 |
| 80 - 89 | 120 |
| 70 - 79 | 105 |
| 69 & below | 90 |

## **Attendance and Class Participation**

Special Note for the Online Section: the online section will be asynchronous - meaning no class meetings (besides the workshops). You are expected to follow the flipped classroom model (described below). And if you need help for course work (e.g. exercises, Q&As, group work), contact your Python tutors (for course related questions), or myself for assistance.

### __Flipped Classroom__: 
This course, including both the in-person and the online sections, will follow a _flipped classroom_ manner. Which means the lectures  will be released to you __prior__ to every schedule class meeting. It is __mandatory__ for you to go through the lectures prior to the class meetings. The actual class meeting will be mainly for course work (e.g. exercises, Q&As, group work). In order for this model to work, it is crucial for you to come in __prepared__. 

### __Note Taking__: 
While you are going through the class lectures, make sure you take notes.  In most of the lecture notebooks, there are some exercise questions. You will need to submit exercise files after most of the classes. We will use a _buddy system_ in which students form 2-3 people groups for comparing notes and codes. Be aware that some of the material discussed in class will NOT be covered in the textbook, but will often appear in the assignments/projects. You will need to submit exercise files after most of the classes. Of course, I realize that in some cases unforeseeable emergencies arise. If you need to miss class for a legitimate, predictable reason, you must inform me and also take the initiative as early as possible to mitigate the effects of that absence. For example, you should establish a buddy system and ask another peer to take notes, handouts for you. You should find out what took place in the class prior to your next class attendance.

### __Regarding ChatGPT and Other Generative AI__: 
As someone working in AI for a living, I cannot stop you using tools like ChatGPT for help. But make sure you use them as your personal tutor, not in place of you. That means you should not just post the coding problems and blindly copy/paste the answer and submit it (most of the time they __DO NOT__ work!!!).

Properly use GAI, including ChatGPT, include carefully coming up with a train of thoughts, test the code snippets/answers given to you, and be able to *debug* any errors. Keep in mind that if the work you turned in is questionable, you will be called in to explain it. Inablity to do so will be considered academic dishonesty, and result in failing the deliverable or the whole course.

### __Respect and Dignity__: 
It is also important for each of us as individuals to respect each other. Treat your classmates with respect and dignity (I like to call this R&D). Listen carefully to the questions and comments while keeping an open mind for ideas. It is okay to disagree with certain viewpoints, but present your arguments in a courteous manner. Negative body la-guage such as rolling your eyes, using phrases such as “that was a dumb idea”, or interrupting others to express disagreements runs counter to the spirit of positive learning environment and is not okay. At the end of the day, we would like to create a positive environment that is conducive to learning.

### __Professionalism__: 
As budding professionals and business majors, conduct yourself in a professional manner just as you would with an employer or colleague. Make sure you meet the due dates (see Course Outline for details), only ask proper questions (you should not reach out to me or the tutor(s) if you haven't tried it yourself), and contribute positively to class discussions (e.g., during workshops). Maintain contact with me and your tutor(s) via Slack professionally. Only software tools required for the class (e.g. Google Colab) or note taking software (e.g., Evernote) the class time.

## Other Course Policies

### __Computer and Lab__:
It is your responsibility to make sure that your laptop is up-to-date so that it runs the system smoothly. You will need to have access to a Jupyter environment to complete the course work - fail to do so will lead to failing the course.

### __Course Materials__: 
All the teaching materials, including assignments and exams, are the intellectual properties of Fairfield University – distributing such materials without written approval is strongly prohibited.

### __Late Submissions__: 
Grades become official one week after assignments/exams have been returned by the instructor. Late submissions might be accepted with a 10% grade penalty. Oral excuses are not acceptable. No make-up opportunities would be given to final deliverables of projects.

### __Class Communications and Feedbacks__: 
We will use __Slack__ for __all__ course communications. __DO NOT SEND EMAIL TO YOUR PROFESSORS. DM instead.__  You need to join the ``#data5405`` channel to communicate with me ,the tutors, and the class. Normally, I would reply to your DM no longer than __12__ hours. Allow more time during weekends and holidays. Feedbacks on your assignments/deliverables will generally be returned to your within a week after the due of the assignment. After receiving the feedback (and grade), you have __three (3)__ days to dispute a grade with proper justified reasons. 

### __Academic Honesty__: 
Fairfield University’s primary purpose is the pursuit of academic excellence. All members of the Fairfield University community share responsibility for establishing and maintaining appropriate standards of academic honesty and integrity. This is possible only in an atmosphere where discovery and communication of knowledge are marked by scrupulous, unqualified honesty. In the event of such dishonesty, professors are to award a grade of zero for the project, paper, or examination in question, and may record an F for the course itself. This also include using any Generative AI as detailed in the "__Regarding ChatGPT and Other Generative AI__" policy.

### __Students with Disabilities__: 
Fairfield University is committed to providing qualified students with disabilities an equal opportunity to access the benefits, rights and privileges of its services, programs and activities, in an accessible setting. Fur-thermore, in compliance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and Connecticut State laws, we provide reasonable accommodations to qualified students, to reduce the impact of disabilities on academic functioning or upon other major life activities. 

### __Online Office/Coaching Hours__: 
You can reserve your spot for office hours via [calendly](https://calendly.com/jtao-4/office-hours).
